# FLASH-DELIVERY APP

## Description

Flash Delivery is a mobile application designed to empower women entrepreneurs in Kigali, Rwanda, by providing a platform for local beauty and hygiene product sales. The app allows users to browse a wide range of products, make purchases, track deliveries, and interact with sellers, all while providing offline functionality and supporting Firebase as the backend. It integrates seamlessly with Firebase for real-time data storage, authentication, and offline capabilities, enabling users to continue shopping even without an active internet connection.
The goal is to create an inclusive, accessible, and user-friendly mobile application to support local businesses and help women entrepreneurs expand their market reach through technology.

## Deployment Plan

### Firebase Backend
-Firebase Authentication: To manage user sign-in and authentication securely.

-Firestore Database: For storing product data, user profiles, and orders in real-time.

-Firestore Database: For storing product data, user profiles, and orders in real-time.

-Firebase Cloud Functions: If additional backend logic is needed (e.g., sending notifications, order processing).

### Deployment Steps
-Frontend Deployment:

Deploy the Android app on Google Play Store and the iOS app on the Apple App Store using their respective guidelines.  
Firebase services will handle the backend side (Firestore, Storage, Authentication) once the app is connected.

-Backend Deployment:

Connect Firebase services (Firestore, Authentication, Storage) to the Flutter app.  
Firebase handles the backend deployment automatically.  
Cloud Functions can be written in Firebase and deployed to handle advanced backend logic.

-CI/CD:

You can set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with GitHub Actions or any other preferred tool to automatically deploy new versions of the app whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.

GitHub Actions: Automates builds and testing.

Firebase Hosting: If you're adding a web version of the app, Firebase Hosting can be used to deploy the web app.

-Monitoring and Updates:
Firebase provides built-in monitoring tools to check performance and errors. You can use Firebase Analytics to monitor app usage and Firebase Crashlytics for reporting bugs.
